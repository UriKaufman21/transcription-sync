I have input sources that output updated and new annotated transcription over audio files.

I want to take these sources, make them all into the same format,  and save that format into two dbs that will be continuously syncronized.

Input sources:
I have a mysql db with this scheme - youtube_db:
video_url , channel, start_time, end_time, transcript, is_valid, update_date, creation_date

And i have an api that sends out requests in this scheme: custom_api:
Audio_byes, transcript, is_valid, update_date, creation_date

The desired format:
audio_id (string that will link to an audio db that i will maintain, that means that every time a new annotation is added, i need to save the audio from that annotation to my audio db)
Transcript: the text
Is_valid: bool
Update_date: datetime
Creation_date: datetime
Input_source: string, if it came from youtube_db, then youtube, if custom_api, custom

The output_db:
Sql and elastic dbs that will hold that desired information and be continuously synced

Create a docker compose that will ensemble everything that you need, create mockups for everything that you need, if something is not define, define it yourself and just let me know. And obviously write and deploy the necessary code, write tests that will verify everything runs accrotding to the specifications, e2e, component, integration, and show me how to run them, this should be a production product, also, show me the project structure
